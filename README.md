An ES6 module is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows you to organize JavaScript code into reusable pieces, promoting better maintainability and scalability. It provides a standardized way to export and import functionality between different JavaScript files, making it easier to work with modular code.

Benefits:
Code Organization: Breaks your code into smaller, manageable chunks that can be imported as needed.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the application, making the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Maintainability: With modular code, debugging, updating, and testing become much easier.
ES6 modules work natively in modern JavaScript environments (browsers and Node.js) and enable a cleaner, more structured approach to writing JavaScript.
